If there are mistakes in the original text, leave them as is.\n- Ensure that you follow the set order (1-14) when identifying the words or phrases, that way there are no overlaps with identifying text components. This is because each word/phrase can only be assigned to one category. Once a word or phrase has been assigned to a category, it cannot be used again in another text component.","fewShotExamples":[{"chatbotResponse":"Bao <mark data=\"16,*\">loves</mark> his <mark data=\"24,*\">group</mark> he wil <mark data=\"19,*\">always</mark> giv them a <mark data=\"17,*\">HD</mark>.
